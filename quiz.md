1. Why do we need to `import React from "react"` in our files?
React defines JSX

2. If I were to console.log(page) in index.js, what would show up?
js object


3. What's wrong with this code:
```
const page = (
    <h1>Hello</h1>
    <p>This is my website!</p>
)
```
There is no outer tag (parent element) to hold them...

4. What does it mean for something to be "declarative" instead of "imperative"?
in the Imperative way we should tell the PC what and how to do something
The Declarative we should only tell what we want, the PC will know the how...


5. What does it mean for something to be "composable"?
We can take it apart to modules and use the mpdules as lego bricks to build something
